1. As the DbPool object has to be borrowed by the HTTP handler function, it's better either to work with transactions (wrapping all DB-related functions inside
one transaction) or to grab the PooledConnection<ConnectionManager<Connection>> object from the pool and pass it to the DAO functions. If the pool is passed to multiple
functions, as it can't be passed as a mutable reference, it will give errors like "cannot borrow `pool` as mutable to more than one function at a time.
